# Project Motivation

This Udacity Nanodegree project. I picked Stackoverflow Developer Survey Data to find answer to below questions:

1.	“What database management software is often used to work between MYSQL and PostgreSQL in Indonesia?”
2.	“How percentage is the comparison between MySQL and PostgreSQL as a database management software?”
3.	“What is MySQL the most widely used database management platform in Indonesia?”
